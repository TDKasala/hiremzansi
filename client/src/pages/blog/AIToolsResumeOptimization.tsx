            <li>
              <strong>Initial Screening:</strong> 87% of large South African companies and 64% of medium-sized businesses now use some form of ATS to filter applications
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Keyword Matching:</strong> Most systems use natural language processing to identify relevant skills, qualifications, and experience
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Semantic Analysis:</strong> Advanced systems evaluate context and relevance, not just exact keyword matches
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Qualification Verification:</strong> Some systems specifically scan for South African qualifications like NQF levels and professional registrations
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Readability Assessment:</strong> AI can evaluate how well-written and structured your CV is

          <p>
            To maximize the effectiveness of these AI tools, follow these strategic approaches:
          </p>
          
          <h3>1. Layered Keyword Implementation</h3>
          
          <p>
            Modern ATS systems use semantic analysis, so instead of keyword stuffing, implement a layered approach:
          </p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Primary keywords:</strong> Include exact matches from the job description in prominent positions
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Semantic variations:</strong> Use related terms and synonyms throughout your content
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Context integration:</strong> Ensure keywords appear in achievement-oriented sentences
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Skill clustering:</strong> Group related skills to demonstrate depth in particular areas
            </li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>
            For example, if a job requires "project management," also include related terms like "project coordination," "milestone tracking," and "deliverable management."
          </p>
          
          <h3>2. South African Context Optimization</h3>
          
          <p>
            Ensure your resume is optimized for South African ATS systems by:
          </p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Including NQF levels:</strong> Clearly state National Qualifications Framework levels for all qualifications
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>B-BBEE information:</strong> Where relevant, include your B-BBEE status in the appropriate section
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Local certifications:</strong> Highlight South African professional registrations and memberships
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Industry-specific terminology:</strong> Use terms common in South African industries rather than international equivalents
            </li>
          </ul>
          
          <h3>3. Strategic ATS Formatting</h3>
          
          <p>
            Ensure your resume structure supports ATS readability:
          </p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Clean hierarchy:</strong> Use consistent heading structures (H1 for main sections, H2 for subsections)
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Standard section labels:</strong> Use conventional section titles like "Experience" rather than creative alternatives
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Chronological structure:</strong> Present experience in reverse chronological order
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Simple formatting:</strong> Avoid tables, columns, headers/footers, and text boxes
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Compatible file formats:</strong> Submit in .docx or ATS-friendly PDF formats (text-based, not scanned)
            </li>
          </ul>
          
          <h3>4. Achievement Quantification</h3>
          
          <p>
            AI tools can help identify and improve achievement statements by:
          </p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Adding metrics:</strong> Include specific numbers, percentages, and monetary values
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Contextualizing achievements:</strong> Compare results to benchmarks or previous performance
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Including scope indicators:</strong> Team size, project budget, timeline constraints
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Highlighting recognition:</strong> Awards, promotions, or special acknowledgments
            </li>
          </ul>
          
          <div className="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded my-4">
            <p className="font-bold">Instead of:</p>
            <p>"Improved sales performance and managed client relationships."</p>
            <p className="font-bold">Use AI to transform into:</p>
            <p>"Increased regional sales by 37% within 8 months by implementing targeted account strategies and nurturing 14 key client relationships, resulting in R3.2M additional revenue and recognition as Top Sales Performer Q2 2024."</p>
          </div>
          
          <h2>Limitations and Ethical Considerations of AI Resume Tools</h2>
          
          <p>
            While AI tools offer significant benefits, be aware of these important limitations:
          </p>
          
          <h3>Accuracy and Context Understanding</h3>
          
          <ul>
            <li>AI may not fully understand nuanced career paths or unconventional experience</li>
            <li>Tools designed for international markets may miss South African context</li>
            <li>Industry-specific terminology may be misinterpreted</li>
            <li>Achievements may be incorrectly evaluated without context</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h3>Ethical Use of AI in Resume Creation</h3>
          
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Accuracy is essential:</strong> Never include false information or exaggerated claims
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Maintain authenticity:</strong> Ensure the resume still reflects your genuine experience and voice
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Use AI as an assistant:</strong> Review and verify all AI-generated content
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Disclose relevant skills:</strong> If you've used advanced AI tools, this could be a relevant technical skill itself
            </li>
          </ul>
