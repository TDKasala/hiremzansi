# How to Beat ATS Systems in South Africa: A Complete Guide for 2025

In today's competitive South African job market, with unemployment rates hovering around 32%, your CV needs to do more than impress human recruitersâ€”it must first pass through Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS). These AI-powered gatekeepers filter out CVs that don't match specific criteria, meaning even highly qualified candidates may never reach human eyes.

## What is an ATS and Why Does it Matter in South Africa?

Applicant Tracking Systems are software applications that help employers manage the recruitment process. In South Africa, where an average corporate job opening receives over 200 applications, companies increasingly rely on these systems to streamline their hiring processes.

South African recruiters face unique challenges that make ATS systems particularly prevalent:
- High volume of applications due to significant unemployment rates
- Need to comply with B-BBEE legislation
- Requirements to verify South African qualifications like NQF levels
