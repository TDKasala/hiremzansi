2. **Fallback:** On xAI failure, automatically switch to OpenAI
3. **Error Handling:** Graceful degradation with informative logging

### Configuration
Updated configuration across all services:
```typescript
// xAI Configuration (Primary)
const xai = new OpenAI({ 
  baseURL: "https://api.x.ai/v1", 
  apiKey: process.env.XAI_API_KEY 
});

// OpenAI Configuration (Fallback)
const openai = new OpenAI({ 
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY 
});
```

### Model Selection
- **Primary Model:** `grok-2-1212` (131K context window)
- **Fallback Model:** `gpt-4o` (latest OpenAI model)

### Logging and Monitoring
Enhanced logging for:
- Successful xAI API calls
- Fallback activation events
- Performance metrics
- Error tracking
