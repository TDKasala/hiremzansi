# Template Security System Documentation

## Overview
This security system prevents premium users from monetizing or abusing the ATSBoost template generation service. It implements multiple layers of protection to ensure templates are only used by legitimate subscribers for their personal use.

## Key Security Features

### 1. Usage Tracking & Rate Limiting
- Daily limit: 10 template generations per user
- Monthly limit: 100 template generations per user
- Automated tracking of usage patterns to detect suspicious activity

### 2. Digital Watermarking System
- **Visible watermarking**: Each generated template includes a visible footer with user information and generation timestamp
- **Invisible watermarking**: Content contains embedded tracking codes that aren't visible but can be detected
- **Security codes**: Each template has a unique verification code that can be validated

### 3. Identity & Device Tracking
- Records user information, device details, and IP address with each template generation
- Creates unique security identifiers based on user and context information
- Enables tracing of templates back to their source even if content is modified

### 4. Abuse Prevention
- Templates include user-specific information that makes commercial redistribution obvious
- Security codes can be verified to check template authenticity
- Usage patterns are monitored to detect potential abuse

## Implementation Details

### Template Security Service
The `templateSecurityService` provides the following functionality:
- Usage limit checking
- Security code generation
- Watermarking application
- Template verification
- Usage tracking

### API Endpoints
All template generation endpoints now include:
- Usage limit validation
- Security information generation
- Visible and invisible watermarking
- Usage tracking
- Security code verification

### Database Storage
The system is designed to work even without database changes, but can be enhanced with:
- A migration script to add template tracking tables
- Usage statistics tracking in the subscription table
- Detailed template generation logs

## How to Verify Templates
Templates can be verified by:
1. Checking the visible watermark at the bottom of templates
2. Verifying the security code through the template verification API
3. Examining the template metadata for authenticity information

## Future Enhancements
Future improvements could include:
- Machine learning for detecting suspicious usage patterns
- Enhanced invisible watermarking techniques
- Blockchain-based verification system
- PDF metadata embedding for exported templates
